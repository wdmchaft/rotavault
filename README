RotaVault - easy secure backup rotation

RotaVault is a Mac OS X software specifically written for realizing secure and
easy backup rotation in combination with Time Machine. RotaVault combines the
fast block-copy method from apple software restore tool (asr) with encrypted
standard Mac OS X image files (dmg), a simple scheduling mechanism based on
the apple launchd framework and flexible reporting options in order to
simplify unattended secure and fast backups of Time Machine disks onto
removable media.

RotaVault is free software published under MIT Licence (see LICENCE for more
information).
